In case you’ve opened the app before, the lines you’ve chosen the previous time you used it will be presented on the home screen for the current day of the week. The ability to change the schedule depending on the day of the week can be done by clicking on the desired day or by scrolling left-right. For every line displayed on the home screen it is shown the schedule for the previous, current and next hour, and in the absence of any of the three, the next three hours are added. By clicking on a collapsed card, it expands and shows the schedule for the whole day, while clicking again the card is collapsed to the nearest 3 hours.
